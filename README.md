### ***Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy (Honors College)*** 🧠💻

🚀 Passionate about CS education, backend systems, databases, and software architecture! I aim to get my PhD and help shape the future of computer science. I also love embedded systems, web development, and optimizations! 

📚 *Fun fact:* I love philosophy just as much as I love code. Ask me about the philosophy of AI! 

🕹️ Huge fan of DND, MTG, and anything nerdy. Also, I have a dog 🐶!
